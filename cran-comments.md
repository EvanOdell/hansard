#Resubmission 
This is the second re-submission of this package. The initial submission used an incorrect license template, this has now been corrected. I have also added a vignette and a message for when the call to the API does not return any data.

For the second re-submission, links in the DESCRIPTION file, the README and the vignette were changed from .data.parliament.uk to <http://www.data.parliament.uk/>.


## Test environments

* ubuntu 14.04 (on Digital Ocean), R 3.3.2
* local MacOS 10.11.6 installation, R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
 

##R CMD check results
