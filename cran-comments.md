#Resubmission 
This is the first update of this package. The previous version, 0.2.5, was accepted and published on cran on 2016-11-12. 

This version, 0.3.4, provides four new functions that allow for search parameters to be included in the function call. They are: `lords_vote_record`, `mp_questions`, `mp_vote_record` and `mp_edms`. An example of `mp_vote_record` has been added to the vignette.

This update also includes the new function `hansard_basic()` which uses console input to walk through the various steps of calling to the API. 

There are also bug fixes for `lords_attendance`, deprecation of `lords_ammendments` in favour of `lords_amendments`

Fixed an issue with `lords_written_questions` and `commons_written_questions` returning a 404 error on some requests.
