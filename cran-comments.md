# Resubmission 

This is the 8th update of this package. The previous version, 0.6.3, was 
accepted and published on CRAN on 2019-01-10. This version fixes errors that
were sometimes occuring in CRAN checks - as of 2019-05-18 there do not appear 
to be any errors but there were on 2019-05-05 and this update prevents those 
errors from re-occuring. This update also introduces a new parameter option
to the `commons_division()` function.
